📈 Key Insights from Analysis
✅ My general view was that the female age groups 60-69, 50-59 years, and male age groups 60-70, and 50-59 years had 80% Yes or No responses to all the attributes that were used in the survey.
✅ Most of the respondents who had lung cancer and other symptoms and causes were between the age groups of 60-69 (Females), 50-59 (Females), and 60-70 (Males), 50-59 (Males)
